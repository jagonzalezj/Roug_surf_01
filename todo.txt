# What we will do next time : 
  play with the sphere mode and make the more efficient we can, and the closer to the ending version we can

# We need: 
  - rough sphere, slab and wires from 1e5 to 1e7 atoms top easily made
  - to be able to output a mesh (even a simple one)
  - to be able to have doc/benchmark

# REQUIREMENTS: 
  - python libs shapely, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, stl (pip, before installing numpy-stl), numpy-stl (pip), 


  To install PyMesh: 
  	- https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#download-the-source
	- sudo ./setup.py build
       	- sudo ./setup.py install
	- python -c "import pymesh; pymesh.test()"	# to verify	


## 1st; work on the sphere part
  - verify if the creation of teh original sample with atomsk is implemented
